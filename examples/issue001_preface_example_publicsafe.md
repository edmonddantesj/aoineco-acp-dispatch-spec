# ACP Dispatch — Issue 001 Preface (Example, public-safe)

> This is **dummy content** for demonstration only.

[REPORT OPEN]
This report is a proof-driven brief submitted to Headquarters (HQ), compressing the last cycle’s observations, experiments, and synthesis by the ACP expedition unit.
We operate a repeatable pipeline — Field Signals → Refinement (schema + proofs) → Supplies (reports + productizable artifacts) — to deliver actionable intelligence that operators and builders can use immediately.

> **KR excerpt (quote-only):**
> "본 보고서는 ACP 탐사대가 지난 주기 동안 수행한 관측/실험/정리 작업을 증빙 기반으로 압축해 본대에 제출하는 요약본이다."

## Why we publish this
- Reduce noise, keep only signal: publish verifiable proofs.
- Make it reusable: schemas, checklists, repeatable procedures.
- Disclose responsibly: two-rail (Public/Internal).

## What this issue delivers
1) Observation summary
2) Proof bundle
3) Reproducible execution fragments

Proof-first. Reproducible. Accountable.
