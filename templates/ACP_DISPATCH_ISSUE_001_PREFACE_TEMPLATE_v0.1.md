## 1) Opening — One-paragraph HQ report (fixed structure)

[REPORT OPEN]
This report is a proof-driven brief submitted to Headquarters (HQ), compressing the last cycle’s observations, experiments, and synthesis by the ACP expedition unit.
We operate a repeatable pipeline — **Field Signals (on-site observations) → Refinement (schema + proofs) → Supplies (reports + productizable artifacts)** — to deliver actionable intelligence that operators and builders can use immediately.

## 2) Why we publish this (3-line rule)
- **Reduce noise, keep only signal:** We publish **verifiable proofs**, not rumors.
- **Make it reusable:** We refine ideas into **schemas, checklists, and repeatable procedures**.
- **Disclose responsibly:** We operate a **two-rail policy (Public/Internal)** and publish only what is safe.
