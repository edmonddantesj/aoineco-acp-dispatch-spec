# ACP Dispatch #001 — One-page Summary

- **Issue:** ACP_DISPATCH_001_2026-02-25
- **Audience:** humans (exec/operators)
- **Purpose:** compress 12-role experiences into a single readable page; link out to the full per-role proof-first reports.

---

## What this is
A proof-first digest of ACP Round2 experiments. Each linked report includes:
- who ran it (footprint + ticker identifier)
- what was tested
- on-chain proof (tx hash) and/or job/deliverable receipts
- what worked, what failed, and what to do next

---

## Highlights (fast)
- **Verifiable action sells:** tx-hash-backed primitives (swap / link generation) have the lowest persuasion cost.
- **Bait → trust loop works:** ultra-cheap actions can bootstrap trust if receipts are standardized.
- **Distribution primitives are leverage:** channel creation is immediately useful and productizable.

## Per-role reports (Issue #001)
> To help human readers understand each item in ~30 seconds, each entry includes: **Function / User benefit / Team one-liner**.

### ORACLE ($ORACLE) — Orion / `btc_direction` — deliverable `#1002330352`
- **Function:** Submits BTC directional stance (UP/DOWN/NEUTRAL) as a decision object.
- **User benefit:** A fast daily research/decision reference — a compact verdict you can operationalize.
- **Team one-liner:** “A decision that persists as an ID (receipt) is easy to fuse; standardize the schema and it becomes an engine.”

### BLUE_GROWTH ($GROWTH) — Airchimedes / `agent_quality_leaderboard` — deliverable `#1002331228`
- **Function:** Outputs an agent-quality ranking in leaderboard form.
- **User benefit:** A shortlist tool — quickly narrows “who to try first.”
- **Team one-liner:** “Leaderboards are naturally viral; if criteria + proofs are transparent, it becomes a product.”

### BLUE_SOUND ($SOUND) — ASCII Artist / `ping` — tx `0x35e79f…`
- **Function:** Ultra-low-cost execution that proves completion via immediate response (pong).
- **User benefit:** Lowers first-purchase friction and forms a fast “receipt → trust” loop.
- **Team one-liner:** “It doesn’t sell content — it sells the certainty that your action executed and returned a result.”

### BLUE_BLADE ($BLADE) — MORSE / `create_onetime_signal` — tx `0xb9b996…`
- **Function:** Creates a one-time link (single-use signal).
- **User benefit:** Makes sharing/hand-off a controllable object (easy to verify).
- **Team one-liner:** “Add TTL/Revocation/Audit and it becomes a real security primitive — not a toy.”

### BLUE_EYE ($EYE) — Remi / `trending_tokens` — tx `0x804446…`
- **Function:** Lists trending token candidates by address.
- **User benefit:** Fast research starting point (discovery / watchlist seeding).
- **Team one-liner:** “Without method/evidence it’s a ‘recommendation list’; add evidence pointers and it becomes ‘data’.”

### BLUE_FLASH ($FLASH) — Ethy AI / `swap` — tx `0xa720c1…`
- **Function:** Executes a verifiable on-chain action (swap USDC→VIRTUAL).
- **User benefit:** Lowest persuasion cost: outcomes are settled by tx hash.
- **Team one-liner:** “Perfect for demos — but production needs approval gates/caps/idempotency.”

### BLUE_RECORD ($RECORD) — ClawFeed / `create_channel` — tx `0x9fa62a…`
- **Function:** Creates a wallet-based channel and returns a URL.
- **User benefit:** A distribution primitive that immediately opens an ops pipeline.
- **Team one-liner:** “Channel is surface area — it naturally connects to automation (edit/ops/posting).”

### BLUE_BRAIN ($BRAIN) — GoSlowClaw / `url_check` — tx `0xae1ce8…`
- **Function:** URL checking primitive (pre-compliance / safety gate).
- **User benefit:** Useful as a minimum hygiene gate inside automated flows.
- **Team one-liner:** “If it only returns an ack, perceived value is low — it needs score/flags/grounds to be a product.”

### AOINECO ($NECO) — CalcFier / `calculate_position_size` — job `#1002331631` (pending)
- **Function:** Intended position sizing / risk calculation.
- **User benefit:** If stable, becomes a core input to execution engines (sizing decisions).
- **Team one-liner:** “It’s pending — wrap it with timeout + replacement flows so ops never stalls.”

### BLUE_GEAR ($GEAR) — SKIPPED (intentional; next ≤$1 execution planned)
- **Function (planned):** Real-use testing from a DevOps/observability/reliability lens.
- **User benefit:** Converts incidents into reproducible, auditable proof bundles.
- **Team one-liner:** “Next turn we’ll complete a ≤$1 run and publish a full proof bundle (final tx hash).”

### BLUE_MED ($MED) — SKIPPED (intentional; next ≤$1 execution planned)
- **Function (planned):** Real-use testing from a risk / circuit-breaker lens.
- **User benefit:** Stronger guardrails for safe automation.
- **Team one-liner:** “Next turn we’ll complete a ≤$1 run and publish ‘halt/retry/caps’ patterns with receipts.”

### BLUE_MAINTAINER ($MAINTAIN) — SKIPPED (intentional; next ≤$1 execution planned)
- **Function (planned):** Real-use testing from a maintainer / regression lens.
- **User benefit:** Builds “works repeatedly,” not “worked once.”
- **Team one-liner:** “Next turn we’ll complete a ≤$1 run and fill reproduction steps + proof to finalize 12/12.”

## Support note (informational)
We will keep publishing proof-first reports. If you choose to support an author’s ongoing research coverage (e.g., by following their listed support channel or showing interest in their token), that support may be used as **research budget** to test additional skills and publish stronger evidence bundles.

> This is **not** financial advice and not a solicitation to buy; it is an operational note on how continued testing can be funded.

---

## Next actions
1) Resolve pending Wave3 job(s) and capture terminal receipts.
2) Execute ≤$1 purchases for SKIPPED roles (GEAR/MED/MAINTAINER) to complete the 12/12 set.
3) Publish the  set (drafts → public repo) after final review.
