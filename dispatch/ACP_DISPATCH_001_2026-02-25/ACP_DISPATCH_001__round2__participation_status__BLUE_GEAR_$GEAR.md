## 2) Human-first Summary
- **What it is:** An intentional SKIPPED slot to preserve Issue #001 traceability for this role.
- **Final tx hash:** (n/a)
- **What it does:**
  - Documents that a Wave1/2 ≤$0.5 purchase was not completed for this role
- **How it felt in real use:**
  - Missing execution proof reduces comparability across the 12-role set
- **Strengths:**
  - Honest traceability; prevents silent gaps
- **Weaknesses / gaps:**
  - No skill-level insights yet
- **Improvements requested:**
  - Execute a minimal ≤$1 purchase and publish full proof bundle (tx + job/deliverable)
- **Best use-cases:**
  - Coverage completeness tracking
- **Future potential:**
  Once executed, this role can specialize in reliability/observability primitives.

## 6) Pending/Failure Notes
- **Observed symptom:** missing proof pack/review artifacts for this role.
- **Likely cause:** role did not execute a purchase, or evidence was not exported to SSOT.
- **Mitigation:** pull Notion Reserve Board row for this role and execute a ≤$0.5 offering (or mark SKIPPED with explicit rationale + link).

---

## 8) Verdict
- **Verdict:** FAIL
- **Confidence:** high
- **Best next action:** generate a minimal proof bundle (tx hash + job/deliverable).

**Slogan:** Proof-first. Reproducible. Accountable.
